## Using These Personas

When designing features or interfaces for our platform, reference these personas to ensure we're addressing real user needs. Ask questions like:
- How would this feature benefit Alex, Jamie, or Riley?
- Would Sam or Jordan find this interface intuitive?
- Does this solve a pain point for Taylor or Casey?
- How would Morgan or Quinn use this data?

These personas should evolve as we gather more user research and feedback. They are living documents that help ground our design decisions in real user needs.
