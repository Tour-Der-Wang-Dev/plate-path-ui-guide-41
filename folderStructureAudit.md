# Folder Structure Audit & Recommendations

## Current Structure Assessment

The current folder structure follows a common React application pattern with separate directories for components, hooks, services, etc. However, there are some areas where improvements could be made for better organization, scalability, and developer experience.

## Strengths

- **Clear separation of concerns**: Components, hooks, services, and pages are well-separated
- **Logical UI component organization**: The UI components are well-organized
- **Consistent naming patterns**: Files follow consistent naming conventions

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Feature-based Organization

**Current Issue**: The application has separate folders for different user types (customer, vendor, driver, admin), but the related functionality is scattered across hooks and services.

**Recommendation**: Consider a feature-based organization for larger features, where related components, hooks, and services live together.

```
src/
  features/
    order/
      components/
      hooks/
      services/
      pages/
    restaurant/
      components/
      hooks/
      services/
      pages/
    review/
      components/
      hooks/
      services/
      pages/
    auth/
      components/
      hooks/
      services/
      pages/
```

### 2. Component Sub-Categorization

**Current Issue**: All UI components are in a single flat directory, which will become unwieldy as the application grows.

**Recommendation**: Further categorize UI components by purpose:

```
src/
  components/
    ui/
      data-display/    (For tables, cards presenting data)
      inputs/          (For form elements)
      feedback/        (For alerts, toasts, loaders)
      navigation/      (For menus, breadcrumbs, pagination)
      layout/          (For grid, containers)
      overlays/        (For modals, dialogs, drawers)
    features/          (For feature-specific components)
    pages/             (For page-specific components)
```

### 3. Services Organization

**Current Issue**: Services are all in a flat directory with no clear organization.

**Recommendation**: Organize services by domain or external system:

```
src/
  services/
    api/
      client.ts        (Base API client)
      endpoints/       (API endpoint definitions)
      interceptors/    (API request/response interceptors)
    auth/              (Authentication services)
    storage/           (Local storage services)
    analytics/         (Analytics services)
```

### 4. Type Definitions

**Current Issue**: All types are in a single index.ts file, which will become unwieldy as the application grows.

**Recommendation**: Split types by domain:

```
src/
  types/
    order.ts
    restaurant.ts
    user.ts
    review.ts
    common.ts
    index.ts          (Re-export all types)
```

### 5. Testing Structure

**Current Issue**: No clear structure for tests is visible.

**Recommendation**: Consider co-locating tests with the code they test:

```
src/
  components/
    Button/
      Button.tsx
      Button.test.tsx
      index.ts
```

Or maintain a mirrored structure in a dedicated test directory:

```
src/
  components/
    Button.tsx
tests/
  components/
    Button.test.tsx
```

### 6. Shared Constants and Config

**Current Issue**: No clear location for constants and configuration.

**Recommendation**: Add dedicated directories:

```
src/
  constants/          (App-wide constants)
  config/             (Environment-specific configuration)
```

## Summary of Recommendations

1. **Adopt feature-based organization** for related components, hooks, and services
2. **Sub-categorize UI components** by their purpose
3. **Structure services** by domain or external system
4. **Split type definitions** into domain-specific files
5. **Establish a consistent testing strategy** with clear structure
6. **Create dedicated locations** for constants and configuration

These changes will improve code organization, make the codebase more navigable for new developers, and support better scalability as the application grows.

## Implementation Strategy

If implementing these changes, consider a phased approach:

1. Start with organizing new code according to the new structure
2. Gradually refactor existing code during regular maintenance
3. Document the new structure and patterns in the README.md
4. Update any build or path alias configurations as needed

This approach minimizes disruption while incrementally improving the codebase organization.
